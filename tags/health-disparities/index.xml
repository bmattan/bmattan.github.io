      <title>COVID-19 Projects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Communication Neuroscience Lab&lt;/a&gt; has been actively studying what kind of messaging effectively encourages actions that benefit public health (e.g., wearing masks, avoiding large social gatherings) and greater compassion (e.g., checking in on and supporting vulnerable people). Working together with my fellow lab mates, I have been involved in three manuscripts that investigate how people respond to COVID-19 and pandemic-related health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dispositional-victimhood&#34;&gt;Dispositional Victimhood&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dispositional victimhood (i.e., someone&amp;rsquo;s tendency to feel like a victim in general, not just in the pandemic) has been associated with lower empathy and greater sensitivity to threats. In one study with over 600 participants, we found that dispositional victimhood was associated with more positive responses to stories of people suffering during the pandemic. This greater positivity predicted less support for policies aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus and greater support for quickly reopening the economy. In a registered report (under review), we aim to replicate this finding, testing for specific mechanisms such as empathy and schadenfreude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;narrative-messaging&#34;&gt;Narrative Messaging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative messages are first-person accounts describing someone&amp;rsquo;s personal story. Narrative messages can reduce defensiveness and increase engagement with the message content through relatable protagonists. In this student-led project, we are examining how narrative messaging (vs. matter-of-fact expository messaging) can be used to increase concern for and actions favoring people who are especially vulnerable at this time (e.g., unemployed people, healthcare workers, prisoners). Participants in the narrative condition reported greater transportation into the message compared to participants in the expository condition. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, we also observed indirect effects of narrative (vs. expository) messages, through increased message transportation, on: (1) beliefs that by physical distancing, one can protect vulnerable people, (2) beliefs that members of the target groups (i.e., healthcare workers and people who are incarcerated) were vulnerable, (3) intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors that help family and friends, and (4) intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors that help members of vulnerable groups. Together these results suggest that narratives can be used to motivate prosocial action during the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that the narratives elicit transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;collectivism&#34;&gt;Collectivism&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this student-led project, we hypothesized that collectivism, a cultural variable characterizing the extent that individuals see themselves in relation to others, contributes to people’s willingness to adhere to public health guidance (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing). Consistent with preregistered predictions, across three studies (n=2864), including a U.S. nationally representative sample, people’s collectivist orientation was positively associated with intentions, positive beliefs, norm perceptions, and policy support for the preventive behaviors. In separate analyses at the country level (n=69 countries), more collectivist countries demonstrated lower growth rate in both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Together, these studies demonstrate the positive role of collectivism at the individual- and country-level in reducing COVID-19 transmission, and highlight the need to consider culture in public health policies and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GeoScan Smoking Study</title>
      <link>https://bmattan.github.io/project/geoscan/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;geoscan-project&#34;&gt;GeoScan Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an R01-funded project within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Communication Neuroscience Lab&lt;/a&gt;, GeoScan uses an innovative set of methods to test whether repeated, real-world exposure to point-of-sale tobacco marketing (POSTM) affects smoking behavior, and whether this is mediated by heightened craving and neural responses to POSTM. This novel multi-method approach includes mobile-phone based geolocation tracking, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By adding the ecological validity of observational field methods to the mechanistic insight of neuroimaging, and causal inferences from an experimental design, GeoScan aims to significantly advance actionable insight about POSTM effects in cancer control. Analyses will examine the extent to which POSTM increases brain responses to smoking cues as well as subjective craving, leading to increased smoking behavior&amp;ndash;a leading cause of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;health-inequities-proposal&#34;&gt;Health Inequities Proposal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While helping to manage the GeoScan project, I have been working with pilot data to develop a grant proposal that examines the impact of poverty exposure on the links between momentary experiences of stress, cigarette cravings, and smoking. This proposal is motivated by existing work on the status-health gradient, which refers to the tendency for increasing social status to be associated with increasing health and well-being. Because much of the existing literature on the status-health gradient approaches this question at the society level (e.g., large surveys and public archives), it can be difficult to pinpoint the psychological mechanisms linking social status and actual health behaviors like smoking. Fortunately, the multi-modal approach of the GeoScan project affords several opportunities to examine the immediate psychological effects of poverty exposure on smoking, which is a leading cause of cancer. Concretely, I propose to study the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Does increasing exposure to poverty (defined by the average percentage of households below poverty at one’s current location within a ~4-hour time period) increase the positive association between stress (negative mood) and cigarette cravings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) Does increasing exposure to poverty increase the positive relationship between cigarette cravings and smoking frequency (i.e., cigarettes smoked per hour)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) Is the indirect effect of stress on smoking through increased cigarette cravings stronger when participants find themselves within high-poverty areas?&lt;/p&gt;
