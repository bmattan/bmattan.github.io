      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Communication Neuroscience Lab&lt;/a&gt; has been actively studying what kind of messaging effectively encourages critical health behaviors (e.g., sheltering in place) and greater compassion (e.g., checking in on and supporting vulnerable people). Working together with my fellow lab mates, I have been involved in two core projects focused on COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;narrative-messaging&#34;&gt;Narrative Messaging&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrative messages are first-person accounts describing someone&amp;rsquo;s personal story. Narrative messages can reduce defensiveness and increase engagement with the message content through relatable protagonists. In this project, we are examining how narrative messaging can be used to increase concern for and actions favoring people who are especially vulnerable at this time (e.g., unemployed people, healthcare workers, prisoners). Preliminary results from this project suggest that concern for the vulnerable depends on one&amp;rsquo;s perceived interdependence on others, one&amp;rsquo;s current employment situation, and/or one&amp;rsquo;s immediate reactions to the message itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;social-networks&#34;&gt;Social Networks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another project that is still in its early stages, I am working to understand how characteristics of one&amp;rsquo;s social network (e.g., how connected is everyone within the participant&amp;rsquo;s social network?) might shape receptivity to and sharing of COVID-19-related content on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GeoScan Smoking Study</title>
      <link>https://bmattan.github.io/project/geoscan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an R01-funded project within the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cn.asc.upenn.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Communication Neuroscience Lab&lt;/a&gt;, GeoScan uses an innovative set of methods to test whether repeated, real-world exposure to point-of-sale tobacco marketing (POSTM) affects smoking behavior, and whether this is mediated by heightened craving and neural responses to POSTM. This novel multi-method approach includes mobile-phone based geolocation tracking, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By adding the ecological validity of observational field methods to the mechanistic insight of neuroimaging, and causal inferences from an experimental design, GeoScan aims to significantly advance actionable insight about POSTM effects in cancer control. Analyses will examine the extent to which POSTM increases brain responses to smoking cues as well as subjective craving, leading to increased smoking behavior&amp;ndash;a leading cause of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping manage GeoScan, I am interested in expanding the aims of this project to include a focus on health disparities. We are currently developing a set of questions that is motivated by existing work on economic inequality and its negative impacts on health and well-being. Because much of the existing literature has approached this relationship at the society level (e.g., large surveys and public archives), it can be difficult to pinpoint the immediate psychological mechanisms linking inequality and actual health behaviors like smoking. Fortunately, the multi-modal approach of GeoScan provides several opportunities to examine the psychological mechanisms underlying not only effects of POSTM exposure on smoking but also more broadly the short-term effects of inequality exposure on smoking, which is a leading cause of cancer. Concretely, we propose to study the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Does increasing exposure to socioeconomic inequality (defined by the gini coefficient of one’s current location over the course of the day) increase key smoking outcomes: smoking frequency, smoking cravings, and neural patterns associated with reward/positivity in response to smoking cues?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) What are the long-term consequences of exposure to economic inequality (defined by the gini coefficient of one’s primary childhood address)?&lt;/p&gt;
