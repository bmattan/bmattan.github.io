abstract = {Those who are high in external motivation to respond without prejudice tend to focus on non-racial attributes when describing others (Norton, Sommers, Apfelbaum, Pura, {\&} Ariely, 2006). This fMRI study examined the neural processing of race and an alternative yet stereotypically relevant attribute (viz., socioeconomic status: SES) as a function of the perceiver's external motivation to respond without prejudice (EMS). Sixty-one White participants privately formed impressions of Black and White faces ascribed with high or low SES. Analyses focused on regions supporting race-and status-based reward/salience (NAcc), evaluation (VMPFC), and threat/relevance (amygdala). Consistent with previous findings from the literature on status-based evaluation, we observed greater neural responses to high-status (vs. low-status) targets in all regions of interest when participants were relatively low in EMS. In contrast, we observed the opposite pattern when participants were relatively high in EMS. Notably, all effects were independent of target race. In summary, White perceivers' race-related motivations similarly altered their neural responses to the SES of Black and White targets.},
