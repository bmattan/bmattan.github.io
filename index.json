In this study, I used a data-driven method to identify separate patterns of neural co-activation indexing judgments of self-relevance and valence and then explored how these patterns can be used to predict receptivity to health messaging.\nUsing fMRI data from a localizer task that asks participants to judge the self-relevance and valence of trait adjectives, I conducted two separate partial least squares (PLS) analyses. Each PLS analysis contrasted either self-relevance or valence judgments with a letter case judgment control task. Despite high overall similarity between the resulting maps, r=.95, I identified a cortical midline pattern (VMPFC/PCC) that showed maximal divergence between the self-relevance and valence judgment patterns (see Figure). For each whole-brain and midline-masked map, I computed trial-wise dot product similarity to betaseries images reflecting neural responses to messages in a separate messaging task promoting physical activity in 158 sedentary adults. I then used these trial-wise similarity scores to predict message ratings and subsequently measured changes in everyday physical activity.\nSimilarity to either whole-brain PLS map (i.e., for self-relevance or valence) was associated with: (1) lower in-scan ratings of relevance of messages, and (2) less post-scan message agreement. In sum, similarity to whole-brain neural patterns tracking deliberation about the self-relevance or valence of information was associated with reduced message receptivity, suggesting possible counterarguing. Within the midline-masked images, I found that similarity to the masked valence judgment map was generally associated with lower message receptivity, as in the whole-brain similarity analyses. However, trial-wise similarity to the masked self-relevance judgment map was associated with increased message receptivity.\nThese findings suggest that increased coactivation between the VMPFC and PCC that arises during deliberate judgments of self-relevance may be part of a neural signature underlying message receptivity. Moving beyond a focus on mean activity in singular brain regions, these findings highlight potential predictive utility of commonalities and differences in the neural patterns of coactivation underlying judgments about self-relevance and valence. Specifically, coordinated neural activity within the VMPFC/PCC resembling patterns that arise during judgments about self-relevance (and not valence) are associated with increased receptivity to message-based interventions promoting real-world physical activity.\n","date":1609615980,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609714871,"objectID":"9318373cc5eda9ed70f1e76d223af982","permalink":"https://bmattan.github.io/project/pa2/","publishdate":"2021-01-02T19:33:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pa2/","section":"project","summary":"Inspired by the Communication Neuroscience Lab's brain-as-predictor approach, I am interested in understanding how momentary similarity to key neural patterns can predict receptivity to messaging.

Working together with my fellow lab mates, I have been involved in three manuscripts that investigate how people respond to COVID-19 and pandemic-related health messaging.\nDispositional Victimhood Dispositional victimhood (i.e., someone\u0026rsquo;s tendency to feel like a victim in general, not just in the pandemic) has been associated with lower empathy and greater sensitivity to threats. In one study with over 600 participants, we found that dispositional victimhood was associated with more positive responses to stories of people suffering during the pandemic. This greater positivity predicted less support for policies aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus and greater support for quickly reopening the economy. In a registered report (under review), we aim to replicate this finding, testing for specific mechanisms such as empathy and schadenfreude.\nNarrative Messaging Narrative messages are first-person accounts describing someone\u0026rsquo;s personal story. Narrative messages can reduce defensiveness and increase engagement with the message content through relatable protagonists. In this student-led project, we are examining how narrative messaging (vs. matter-of-fact expository messaging) can be used to increase concern for and actions favoring people who are especially vulnerable at this time (e.g., unemployed people, healthcare workers, prisoners). Participants in the narrative condition reported greater transportation into the message compared to participants in the expository condition. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, we also observed indirect effects of narrative (vs. expository) messages, through increased message transportation, on: (1) beliefs that by physical distancing, one can protect vulnerable people, (2) beliefs that members of the target groups (i.e., healthcare workers and people who are incarcerated) were vulnerable, (3) intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors that help family and friends, and (4) intentions to engage in prosocial behaviors that help members of vulnerable groups. Together these results suggest that narratives can be used to motivate prosocial action during the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent that the narratives elicit transportation.\nCollectivism In this student-led project, we hypothesized that collectivism, a cultural variable characterizing the extent that individuals see themselves in relation to others, contributes to people’s willingness to adhere to public health guidance (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing). Consistent with preregistered predictions, across three studies (n=2864), including a U.S. nationally representative sample, people’s collectivist orientation was positively associated with intentions, positive beliefs, norm perceptions, and policy support for the preventive behaviors. In separate analyses at the country level (n=69 countries), more collectivist countries demonstrated lower growth rate in both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Together, these studies demonstrate the positive role of collectivism at the individual- and country-level in reducing COVID-19 transmission, and highlight the need to consider culture in public health policies and communications.\n","date":1609606680,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609714871,"objectID":"e41112012a69dfef3c7b8bf74ff79ccd","permalink":"https://bmattan.github.io/project/covid-19/","publishdate":"2021-01-02T16:58:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/covid-19/","section":"project","summary":"Working with the Communication Neuroscience Lab, I am interested in understanding how different kinds of messaging shape the way we support one another during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a pair of ongoing studies, I will be examining how we differentiate socioeconomic status (SES) based on visible cues such as clothing and more abstract or knowledge-based cues. In another study, I will be examining the assumption based so far on correlational methods that the inferior parietal cortex is responsible for status differentiation. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and mouse tracking, I will test the causal role of this brain region in differentiating hierarchical rank based on person knowledge. In sum, my research highlights both the ways that status can be inferred and the potential neural mechanisms underlying our ability to track our own and others’ positions within a given social hierarchy.\nStatus-Based Evaluations My main line of work in this project demonstrates that perceived status in conjunction with salient social categories (e.g., race) can elicit spontaneous effects in person evaluation. In a series of five experiments (Mattan, Kubota, Venezia, Li, \u0026amp; Cloutier, 2019), I found consistent implicit evaluative bias as a function of perceived SES (i.e., high SES more positive than low SES). These experiments nonetheless revealed some boundary conditions for this novel status priming effect. For example, we found that status priming tended to be larger for White than Black targets.\nIn another study, I used fMRI to examine neural activity in 61 White participants as they formed impressions of Black and White targets (Mattan, Kubota, Dang, \u0026amp; Cloutier, 2018). Univariate analyses revealed that external motivation to respond without racial prejudice (EMS) may attenuate the positive value (e.g., decreased blood flow in the VMPFC, NAcc) and/or salience (e.g., decreased blood flow in the NAcc, amygdala) of high status in a mixed-race context. A separate multivariate analysis (behavioral partial least squares) revealed that EMS was associated with overall less coordination of brain activity (irrespective of target race and status) within networks previously implicated in affect regulation, introspection, and social cognition (Mattan, Kubota, Li, Dang, \u0026amp; Cloutier, 2018). These findings open the door to future studies examining the contributions of this network to difficulties experienced by high-EMS individuals when navigating interracial interactions.\nTaken together, my research on status-based evaluations indicates that race and status biases can spontaneously arise in implicit evaluations and neural responses, potentially compounding existing racial disparities. However, socioeconomic disparities extend beyond race. In my recent work, I have begun to examine the intersections of status with gender. Linking diverse strands of research from social psychology, evolutionary psychology, and social neuroscience, In a registered report (Mattan \u0026amp; Cloutier, 2020) I found that men show greater implicit pro-wealthy bias than do women in a large pre-existing online sample from the Attitudes, Identities, and Individual Differences Study. This work is complemented by an independent fMRI study showing that men show greater responses to high (vs. low) SES targets during impression formation in brain regions associated with positive evaluations such as the VMPFC and nucleus accumbens (Barth, Mattan, Dang, \u0026amp; Cloutier, 2020).\nPerceived Status and Decision Making Extending my work into the domain of decision making, I examined the role of perceived financial status in evaluations of unfair financial offers (e.g., Justice Game: Mattan, Barth, Thompson, FeldmanHall, Cloutier, \u0026amp; Kubota, 2020). I found that participants tended to favor the party with presumed lower standing—-this was the case even among participants reporting above-average subjective SES. Finally, punitive responses were also more likely when the context emphasized the privileged SES of the allocator rather than the underprivileged SES of the recipient. In more recent work, I have been investigating trust decisions in the context of a series of one-off investment decisions. Here, I find that people prefer to invest more in high-status partners, regardless of whether status is ascribed through color-coding or inferred through clothing.

However, studying how status and gender shape deliberate impression formation is difficult due to social desirability concerns. Using univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses (*n* = 65), we examined how gender and socioeconomic status (SES) may influence brain responses during deliberate but private impression formation. Men more than women showed greater activity in the VMPFC and NAcc when forming impressions of high-SES (vs. low-SES) targets. Seed partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that this SES-based increase in VMPFC activity was associated with greater co-activation across an evaluative network for the high- SES versus low-SES univariate comparison. A data-driven task PLS analysis also showed greater co-activation in an extended network consisting of regions involved in salience detection, attention, and task engagement as a function of increasing target SES. This co-activating network was most pronounced for men. These findings provide evidence that high-SES targets elicit neural responses indicative of positivity, reward, and salience during impression formation among men. Contributions to a network neuroscience understanding of status perception and implications for gender- and status- based impression formation are discussed.","tags":["Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex","Social Status","Gender","Partial Least Squares","Person Perception"],"title":"Regional and network neural activity reflect men’s preference for greater socioeconomic status during impression formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

Different factors may moderate the value of high status along a dimension such as wealth (e.g., gender, perceiver income/education). For example, studies suggest men may value wealth and control over resources more than women. This may be especially true for high- income men who already have control over substantial resources. Other work suggests that low-income men and women may have different experiences in educational contexts compared to their richer peers who dominate norms at higher levels of education. These experiences may potentially lead to different attitudes about the wealthy among low-income men and women. In this registered report, we proposed two key predictions based on our review of the literature and analyses of pilot data from the Attitudes, Identities and Individual Differences (AIID) study (*n* = 767): (H1) increasing income will be associated with increased pro-wealthy bias for men more than for women and (H2) income will also moderate the effect of education on implicit pro-wealthy bias, depending on gender. Overall, men showed greater implicit pro-wealthy bias than did women. However, neither of our hypotheses that income would moderate the effects of gender on implicit pro- wealthy bias were supported. These findings suggest implicit pro-wealthy bias among men and are discussed in the context of exploratory analyses of gender differences in self-reported beliefs and attitudes about the rich and the poor.","tags":["Implicit Bias","Social Status","Gender","Income","Education","Individual Differences"],"title":"A registered report on how implicit pro-rich bias is shaped by the perceiver’s gender and socioeconomic status","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

However, the appeal of high-SES people exists in tension with our aversion to inequity. Little experimental work has directly examined how people rectify inequitable distributions between two individuals varying in SES. The objective of the present study was to examine how disinterested third parties adjudicate inequity in the context of concrete financial allocations between a selfish allocator and a recipient who was the victim of the allocator’s selfish offer. Specifically, this study focused on whether knowing the SES of the victim or the allocator affected the participant’s decisions to punish the selfish allocator. In two experiments (*n*=999), participants completed a modified third-party Ultimatum Game in which they arbitrated inequitable exchanges between an allocator and a recipient. Although participants generally preferred to redistribute inequitable exchanges without punishing players who made unfair allocations, we observed an increased preference for punitive solutions as offers became increasingly selfish. This tendency was especially pronounced when the victim was low in SES or when the perpetrator was high in SES, suggesting a tendency to favor the disadvantaged even among participants reporting high subjective SES. Finally, punitive responses were especially likely when the context emphasized the allocator’s privileged status rather than the recipient’s underprivileged status. These findings inform our understanding of how SES biases retributive justice even in non-judicial contexts that minimize the salience of punishment.","tags":["Decision Making","Socioeconomic Status","Justice","Inequality"],"title":"Punishing the privileged: Selfish offers from high-status allocators elicit greater punishment from third-party arbitrators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

Men also preferentially recruited a functional network of regions involved in salience and attention when forming impressions of high-status targets. In a separate analysis of a stratified Project Implicit sample (*n*=175), we found that being wealthy increased men’s implicit pro-rich bias more so than for women. In a registered report (in revision at stage 1) relying on pilot data from the present study, we will attempt to replicate the Project Implicit findings in a larger hold-out dataset (*n*1000).

We want to harness the potential of BJJ to be a force for bringing people from all backgrounds together.\nTo accomplish this mission, Roll the Same (RTS) works in education, advocacy, and community.\n  Education: To provide education, support and resources to drive positive change and make the sport inclusive and safe for all.\n  Advocacy: To maintain a platform and a network committed to increasing access and inclusion in BJJ.\n  Community: To empower individual practitioners to engage with issues of equality and diversity, regardless of rank or level of involvement.\n  My Contributions As a volunteer analyst for RTS, my primary responsibility has been the analysis of mixed-methods data (i.e., quantitative and qualitative data) that were collected as part of the RTS 2020 community climate survey. I then summarized these analyses in a comprehensive report on gender inclusion within BJJ. The full 25-page report is available on the RTS website, but I provide the executive summary here.\nBased on our survey of 579 BJJ practitioners, including 189 women, I found evidence of:\n Gyms and cultures that undervalue women. Sexualization of women by men who are their teammates. No mechanisms of accountability when misconduct arises. Sexism in online BJJ culture.  Apart from being the right thing to do, greater gender inclusion can improve the prestige, profits, and technical prowess of any gym. To create a more welcoming environment, gyms can:\n Be proactive in efforts to teach men how to be good training partners for women. Build general trust in instructors and amongst teammates. Establish and enforce a system that allows women to report sexual harassment/assult without negative consequences.  Future Directions Complementing this report on gender inclusion, RTS also has data that shed light on the inclusion of racial and sexual minorities in BJJ. These data show that problems extend beyond gender inclusion to other minoritized groups. I plan to conduct analyses of these data, leading to the release of future reports on the state of inclusion in BJJ with regards to race and sexuality. Although I was not part of the RTS team when the 2020 community climate survey was conducted, I already have plans for future study proposals that focus on more targeted questions pertaining to social hierarchy within martial arts and its relationship to well-being and inclusion.

This novel multi-method approach includes mobile-phone based geolocation tracking, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By adding the ecological validity of observational field methods to the mechanistic insight of neuroimaging, and causal inferences from an experimental design, GeoScan aims to significantly advance actionable insight about POSTM effects in cancer control.

This proposal is motivated by existing work on the status-health gradient, which refers to the tendency for increasing social status to be associated with increasing health and well-being. Because much of the existing literature on the status-health gradient approaches this question at the society level (e.g., large surveys and public archives), it can be difficult to pinpoint the psychological mechanisms linking social status and actual health behaviors like smoking. Fortunately, the multi-modal approach of the GeoScan project affords several opportunities to examine the immediate psychological effects of poverty exposure on smoking, which is a leading cause of cancer. Concretely, I propose to study the following questions:\n(1) Does increasing exposure to poverty (defined by the average percentage of households below poverty at one’s current location within a ~4-hour time period) increase the positive association between stress (negative mood) and cigarette cravings?\n(2) Does increasing exposure to poverty increase the positive relationship between cigarette cravings and smoking frequency (i.e., cigarettes smoked per hour)?\n(3) Is the indirect effect of stress on smoking through increased cigarette cravings stronger when participants find themselves within high-poverty areas?\n","date":1577990880,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609714871,"objectID":"b74cddcfe059cbfa9f5425a54e9c5d42","permalink":"https://bmattan.github.io/project/geoscan/","publishdate":"2020-01-02T18:48:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geoscan/","section":"project","summary":"Together with the Communication Neuroscience Lab, I am exploring how stress and exposure to economic inequality affect smoking cravings and behavior using fMRI, geolocation tracking, and ecological momentary assessments (EMA).","tags":["Health Disparities","Geolocation Tracking","Ecological Momentary Assessment","fMRI"],"title":"GeoScan Smoking Study","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Previous research has identified brain regions supporting person evaluations, but are evaluations based on perceptual cues versus person-knowledge processed differently? Moreover, are neural responses consistent when person-knowledge is available but unnecessary for the evaluation? This fMRI study examined how the use and availability of person-knowledge shapes the neural underpinnings of social evaluations. participants evaluated well-known actors based on attractiveness or body of work (i.e., person-knowledge) and unknown models based on attractiveness only. Analyses focused on the VMPFC, following research implicating this region in positive evaluations based on person-knowledge. The VMPFC was sensitive to the (1) availability of person-knowledge, showing greater responses as ratings became more positive for actors (but not models) regardless of rating dimension and (2) use of available person-knowledge, showing greater activity as ratings for likability based on body of work became more positive for actors versus models rated on attractiveness. These findings indicate that although brain regions supporting person evaluation are sensitive to the availability to person-knowledge, they are even more responsive when judgments require the use of available person-knowledge.","tags":["Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex","Social Evaluation","Person Knowledge","Person Perception"],"title":"The ventromedial prefrontal cortex is particularly responsive to social evaluations requiring the use of person-knowledge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

Following initial evidence of a positive implicit bias for high-SES (vs. low-SES) primes, subsequent experiments revealed that this bias is sensitive to target race, particularly when race and SES antecedents are presented in an integrated fashion. Specifically, high-SES positive bias was more reliable for White than for Black targets. Additional analyses examining how implicit biases may be sensitive to perceiver characteristics such as race, SES, and beliefs about socioeconomic mobility are also discussed.

This fMRI multivariate analysis used partial least squares analysis to examine the distributed neural processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly nonracial attribute (i.e., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver’s external motivation. Sixty-one white male participants (*Homo sapiens*) privately formed impressions of black and white male faces ascribed with high or low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was associated with reduced coactivation of brain regions believed to support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex), introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole, medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation is related to the participant’s overall approach to impression formation in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of examining network coactivation in understanding the role of external motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social processes.","tags":["Anterior Cingulate Cortex","Behavioral Partial Least Squares","Motivation","Prejudice","Race","Status"],"title":"Motivation modulates brain networks in response to faces varying in race and status: A multivariate approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

For example, perceiver motivations and/or category cues (e.g., perceptual vs. knowledge-based) can differ depending on whether one is processing race and/or status, ultimately recruiting distinct mechanisms within this common evaluative network.

A survey of the expanding social psychological and neuroscience literatures on status reveals a diversity of focuses (e.g., perceiver vs. agent), operationalizations (e.g., status as dominance vs. wealth), and methodologies (e.g., behavioral, neuroscientific). Accommodating this burgeoning literature on status in person perception, the present review offers a novel social neuroscientific framework that integrates existing work with theoretical clarity. This framework distinguishes between five key concepts: (1) strategic pathways to status acquisition for agents, (2) status antecedents (i.e., perceptual and knowledge-based cues that confer status rank), (3) status dimensions (i.e., domains in which an individual may be ranked, such as wealth), (4) status level (i.e., one’s rank along a given dimension), and (5) the relative importance of a given status dimension, dependent on perceiver and context characteristics. Against the backdrop of this framework, we review multiple dimensions of status in the nonhuman and human primate literatures. We then review the behavioral and neuroscientific literatures on the consequences of perceived status for attention and evaluation. Finally, after proposing a social neuroscience framework, we highlight innovative directions for future social status research in social psychology and neuroscience.","tags":["Person Perception","Social Neuroscience","Social Cognition","Socioeconomic Status","Social Status","Person Evaluation","fMRI","Reviews"],"title":"How social status shapes person perception and evaluation: A social neuroscience perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

In one perceptual matching task and two visual perspe ctive-taking paradigms, we examined age differences in sensitivity to avatars representing self and other. In the matching task, older (60–83 years) and younger (18–20 years) adults were similarly biased toward the self- versus other-associated avatar. In the perspective-taking tasks, participants viewed these avatars within a virtual room. Task-relevant perspectives were either the same (i.e., congruent) or different (i.e., incongruent). In the 3PP–3PP task, both avatars were present, and participants adopted the perspective of one or the other. As in the matching task, young and old were similarly biased toward the self-associated avatar. However, age differences emerged in the 1PP–3PP task, which presented only one avatar per trial (varying between self and other), and participants responded based on their own first-person perspective or the avatar's. In summary, age modulated the ability to take perspectives primarily when participants’ own first-person perspective was task relevant. Relative to younger adults, older adults prioritized the self (vs. other) avatar more during initial perspective computation and the first-person (vs. third-person) perspective more when selecting between incongruent perspectives.","tags":["Self-Prioritization","Visual Perspective Taking","First-Person versus Third-Person","Self-Tagging","Social Cognitive Aging"],"title":"Prioritization of self-relevant perspectives in ageing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

Participants completed a third-person visual perspective-taking task in which they judged the perspectives of two simultaneously presented avatars, designated “Self” and “Other.” Depending on the trial, these avatars either held the same view (i.e., congruent) or a different view (i.e., incongruent). Analyses focused on the relationship between empathy and two perspective-taking phenomena: Selection between competing perspectives (i.e., perspective-congruence effects) and prioritization of the Self avatar’s perspective. Empathy was related to improved overall performance on this task and a reduced cost of selecting between conflicting perspectives (i.e., smaller perspective-congruence effects). This effect was asymmetric, with empathy (i.e., empathic concern) levels predicting reduced interference from a conflicting perspective, especially when adopting the Self (vs. Other) avatar’s perspective. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the self–other distinction and mental flexibility components of empathy.","tags":["Empathy","Visual Perspective Taking","Personal Relevance","Self-Tagging"],"title":"Empathy and visual perspective-taking performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bradley D.

In 2 experiments, participants verified the number of dots within a virtual room that were visible to a given perspective, corresponding to participants’ own first-person perspectives or the third-person perspectives for self- and other-associated avatars. Perspectives were either congruent or incongruent with respect to the number of dots visible to each. In Experiment 1, we examined perspective taking for self- and other-associated avatars relative to one another; both avatars appeared simultaneously in the virtual room, and participants made judgments based on the prompted avatar’s perspective. In Experiment 2, we examined perspective taking for each avatar relative to the first-person perspective; only 1 avatar was visible in the virtual room (Self or Other, varying by trial), and participants made judgments based on their first-person view or the avatar’s perspective. Experiment 2 also included a replication of the third-person paradigm used in Experiment 1. Results from Experiment 1 (replicated in Experiment 2) demonstrated an advantage for judgments of the Self (vs. Other) avatar’s perspective; both avatars elicited reliable interference effects of similar magnitude. Results from Experiment 2 further demon- strated that participants prioritized the first-person (vs. third-person) perspective, and that the presence of the Self (vs. Other) avatar improved performance for the first- and third-person perspectives when those perspectives were congruent. Taken together, these findings suggest that self-relevant perspectives are prioritized when they are actively engaged and when they can be subsumed within the first-person view. Such prioritization appears to occur by strategic means.","tags":["Visual Perspective Taking","Self-Tagging","Personal Relevance","First-Person Versus Third-Person"],"title":"Is it always me first?

The effects of a prosocial video game were examined here. here were three video game conditions: violent (killing bandits), helping (saving people from dying by administering medicine), or neutral (collecting bags of gold), and two control conditions (game expectant but no game played, and no game). In the game playing conditions, participants played ten minutes of a video game built with tools from Neverwinter Nights and tried to earn points by carrying out the assigned task. All participants then completed three stories which were scored for prosocial, aggressive and neutral responses. MANOVA analyses showed a significant effect for the helping condition in increasing prosocial responses. There was no significant difference across conditions for aggressive responses. Findings are discussed in terms of how a helping-oriented game may promote a prosocial expectancy bias.","tags":["Video Games","Moral Psychology","Prosocial Behavior"],"title":"Kill bandits, collect gold or save the dying: The effects of playing a prosocial video game.","type":"publication"}]
